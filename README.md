# redis-ccp-queue

A simple and lightweight Competing Consumers Pattern Queue. Built with [node.js][nodejs-url] and [Redis][redis-url] (just about 100 lines of code).

Enable multiple concurrent consumers to process messages received on the same messaging channel.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install redis-ccp-queue --save
```

### Usage

#### Create a new Producer

```javascript
'use strict';

const ccpq = require('redis-ccp-queue');

let p = new ccpq.Producer('QueueKey');    // create new producer instance

...
p.push('message');                        // push a string message to queue
p.push({ name: 'object', num: 42 });      // push an object to queue
...
```

#### Create a new Consumer

When creating a `consumer` you pass a callback function, that is called every time, when a new message is available from the queue:

```javascript
'use strict';

const ccpq = require('redis-ccp-queue');

let c = new ccpq.Consumer('QueueKey', (data, done) => {  // create new consumer instance
  handleMessage(data, done)
});

// This is the function (callback) that actually handles the messages from the queue.
// Put your worker-code inside this function.
function handleMessage(data, done) {
  console.log('CONSUMER:');
  console.log(data);
  done();                                  // call done() when message is handled
}
```

Within your callback, you need to call the done() function, to let the `consumer` know, that the you are finished with the
message handling. The name of this function can be changed. just choose your preferred name and pass it as a second parameter
name to the callback function.

#### Examples

I have attached a producer as well as a consumer in the `examples` folder.
To see the queue in acton, open three command line instances. Be sure to have redis installed and running.

In the first command line window lauch the producer with

```
npm run producer
```

Then in the second command line window launch the first consumer with

```
npm run consumer
```

and immediately after then in the third command line window launch the second consumer with

```
npm run consumer
```

You should now see both consumers pulling from the queue. Each message is only handled by one of the consumers.
I used some `setTimeout` functions to simulate longer message handling. I also added a timeout to disconnect the
consumers from Redis after a certain period.


## Core concept

The competing consumers pattern enables multiple consumers to pull and handle messages from the same queue,
with the guarantee that each message is consumed once only. This pattern also allows multiple producers or
senders to push messages to the same single queue. The queue is implemented as a FIFO (first in - first out queue):

```
Application instances                                   Consumer service instances pool
generating messages                                                 processing messages


--------------
| Producer 1 | --->
--------------

--------------                                                          --------------
| Producer 2 | --->                                             --->    | Consumer 1 |
--------------                                                          --------------

--------------          -------------------------------------           --------------
| Producer 3 | --->     | ------ ------	------       ------	|   --->    | Consumer 2 |
--------------          | | M5 | | M4 | | M3 | ....> | M1 |	|           --------------
                        | ------ ------ ------       ------ |
       .                -------------------------------------                 .
	     .                       Message Queue (FIFO)                           .
       .                                                                      .

--------------                                                          --------------
| Producer x | --->                                             --->    | Consumer n |
--------------                                                          --------------

--------------
| Producer y | --->
--------------
```

Use this approach when:

- The workload for an application or task is divided into tasks that can run asynchronously.
- Tasks are independent and can run in parallel.
- You need a scalable solution, because the volume of work is highly variable.
- Your solution must provide high availability.


## Reference

#### Producer

| function        | Comments |
| -------------- | ------- |
| new ccpq.Producer(queueName [, options])  | expects an queue name and (optional) Redis Options *)  |
| push(data) | push data to the queue. This can be either a string or an JSON object |
| shutdown() | disconnects safely from Redis |

#### Consumer

| function        | Comments |
| -------------- | ------- |
| new ccpq.Consumer(queueName, callback [, options]) | expects a queue name, your callback function (where you handle/consume the data from the queue) and (optional) Redis Options *) |
| shutdown() | disconnects safely from Redis |

#### *) Connect to Redis
When a new `Producer` or `Consumer` instance is created,
a connection to Redis will be created at the same time.
You can specify which Redis to connect to by:

```javascript
new Producer('QueueKey')                        // Connect to Redis Server at 127.0.0.1:6379
new Producer('QueueKey', 6380)                  // 127.0.0.1:6380
new Producer('QueueKey', '/tmp/redis.sock')
new Producer('QueueKey', {
  port: 6379,                                   // Redis port
  host: '127.0.0.1',                            // Redis host
  family: 4,                                    // 4 (IPv4) or 6 (IPv6)
  password: 'auth',
  db: 0
})
```

You can also specify connection options as a [`redis://` URL](http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/redis):

```javascript
// Connect to 127.0.0.1:6380, db 4, using password "authpassword":
new Redis('redis://:authpassword@127.0.0.1:6380/4')
```

See [ioredis API Documentation](https://github.com/luin/ioredis/blob/master/API.md#new_Redis) for all available options.

## Known Issues

This is the initial version of this package. At the moment, it really does, what I expected is to do.
But I am sure, there is quite a lot of room for improvement. I am happy to discuss any comments and suggestions.
Please feel free to contact me if you see any possibility of improvement!

For the next major version I plan to implement a more reliable version where an additional list is used to track messages in transit.
If a processes fails to deliver with in a specified amount of time, an item could be moved back to the original queue for delivery.
